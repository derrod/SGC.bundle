# Stargate Command Plex Channel

Simple Plex channel to stream content from [Stargate Command](https://www.stargatecommand.co).

This was written quite quickly and without a good knowledge of the Plex API. There *will* be bugs.

The whole URL service thing might be unnecessary and could be moved to the main code as well.

**Missing Features:**
 * Extras
 * "Community" stuff (blog posts with previews etc.)
